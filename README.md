# Home Assistant EnergyID Integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Integrate [EnergyID](https://www.energyid.eu/) into you Home Assistant.

## Installation
At this point the integration is not part of the default HACS repositories, so
you will need to add this repository as a custom repository in HACS.

When this is done, just install the repository.
